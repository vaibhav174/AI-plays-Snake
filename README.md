# AI-plays-Snake
 Trained AI bot that can play snake game on its own using genetic algorithm and neural network
 
 This repository contains:
- The Snake Game itself
- A Genetic Algorithm module
- A Neural Network module
- A main file with toy examples

## Installation

Python 3 was used for this project and I can't promise that older versions are compatibles

Libraries you'll need to run the project:

{``joblib``, ``numpy``, ``numba``, ``pygame``}

## Usage

You will find some ready to run examples in ``main.py`` file.
Everything is explaind in the file, just uncomment parts that you want to execute, then go to terminal and do:
```python main.py```
we have some pre-trained models ready to use
